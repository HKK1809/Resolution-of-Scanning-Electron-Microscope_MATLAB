This lab shows result of various simulations depicting different scenarios for a Scanning
Electron Microscope (SEM). These simulations help better understand the behavior of
SEM and what to expect in differ situation. In this lab report section 2.0 depicts the results
and the code for the simulations and section 3.0 discusses the conclusion.

The MATALB file contains code for problems solved as solution have been depicted in the lab report.
